			<h2 align="center"> Experience at University Of Alberta</h2>
			<p> My Name is Kader Lougue and I am from Ivory Coast (Cote D'Ivoire). I am in my 3<sup>rd</sup> year petroleum engineering at University of Alberta. I have been living in Edmonton since May 2015. <br> Since my first language is French, I started my studies with English at University of Alberta, Faculty of Extension so that I could have a strong level in English before embracing Engineering. After one year, I finished all my English courses, and I started my first year of engineering in Fall 2016.</p>
			<p>The first year was competitive and difficult in the first semester since the English educational system and some materials in Chemistry were new for me. However, with my hard work and determination, I successfully pass all my 6 courses in the first semester with a good gpa. The second semester was also successfully done with an improved gpa. Overall, I complete the first year successfully and obtained 39.5 credits which allowed me to be in my program of choice: petroleum engineering. </p>
			<p> The second year was better than the first year because I was relaxed and did not worry too much about grades; my goal was to learn and understand the materials that were being taught. I learned a lot in almost all the engineering branches: Electrical, Material, Civil, Chemical and Petroleum. I also learned about Earth sciences (types of rocks, properties of rocks, topographic maps ...) which was very important in my field. I took also 6 courses in each semester which resulted in obtaining 44.2 credits and my gpa was increased. I am excited to learn more about petroleum engineering in my third year (Drilling, reservoir, well logging and formation evaluation, production operations...  </p>

			<h2 align="center"> Soccer involvement </h2>
			<p> I have been playing soccer since I arrived in Edmonton. Because I came in Edmonton during the summer and my course load was light, I was playing soccer everyday at University of Alberta, Lister field. I met a lot of people there and made many friends. I was approached by one of my friends asking me to join their team playing the Edmonton league, and I did not refuse. Since then, I have been playing for AFRICANA FC in both indoor and outdoor seasons. <br> I participated in various intramural competitions at University Of Alberta and in Edmonton. I played in total 9 intramurals seasons and many competitions in Edmonton.   </p>

			<h2 align="center"> Passion for Computer Science</h2>
			
			<p> I have been in love with technology since the beginning of my second year, and I did not get time to learn about it. However, after my second year, I dedicated my time to learning about computer science by starting with programing using python and web design and development. My objective is to be capable of designing systems or tools to facilitate or improve some tasks in my field of study using technolgy. I am confident that with determination, I will be able to achieve that goal.</p>
